# Contributing

Good morning, ser,

Your contributions are most welcome.

Whether you are a caddie, golf pro, or world champ in the game of Solidity golf does not matter.

Help collect common Solidity optimization tips and myths in one place, open to anyone to learn from and contribute to.

The following contributing guidelines will help you take your A game to Re:Golf Course:

<br>

Optimizations should be as practical as possible.
<br>
Open an issue if an optimization is somewhat obscure.

Write titles in the imperative.

Explain why the optimization works.
<br>
Teaching us a thing or two about the EVM is even better!

Names should be descriptive.
<br>
No `foo = 4` and `i`. `four = 4` and `index` are better.

Where should this optimization go?
- Caddie: For beginners.
- Golf Pro: Not recommended for beginners.
- World Champ: Next level stuff.

Include tests.
<br>
Use [Optimizooor's Lab](https://github.com/ZeroEkkusu/optimizooors-lab) template and provide the contents of your `Samples.sol` file.
<br>
Alternatively, you may provide a single, custom test file compatible with Foundry.

Keep the repo looking cute \<3
