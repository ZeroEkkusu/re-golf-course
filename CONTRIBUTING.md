Gm, Ser,

Your contributions are most welcome.

Whether you are a caddie, golf pro, or world champ in the game of Solidity golf, does not matter.

With your help, we are going to collect common Solidity optimization tips and myths in one place open to anyone to learn from and expand upon.

The following guidelines will help you take your "A" game to â›³ Re:Golf Course:

- optimizations should be as practical as possible

- explain why the optimization works (and teach us a thing or two about the EVM, if possible)

- names should be descriptive: no `foo = 4` and `i`; `four = 4` and `index` are better

- `Caddie` is for beginners

- `Golf Pro` is not recommended for beginners or is more advanced

- `World Champ` so you can show off your skills

- include tests: use [ðŸ§ª Optimizooor's Lab](https://github.com/ZeroEkkusu/optimizooors-lab) template and provide the contents of your `Samples.sol` file

- alternatively, provide a single, custom test file compatible with Foundry
